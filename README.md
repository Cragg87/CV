Professional but personable, formal but funny, articulate, artistic (and alliterative, apparently), I have eagerly uprooted from a successful career in secondary education to train and work as a software developer. 
Why? 
I desperately wanted a new challenge away from the exhaustion of the classroom, far from the monotony of marking 120 essays on The Rite of Spring or the pangs emanating from abused xylophones. 
I was delighted to secure a place on the highly-acclaimed Makers Academy bootcamp in London, through which I nurtured and grew my once amateur coding skills to a professional standard ready for new and exciting career opportunities.
Combining my knowledge, my clarity of communication and my gentle sense of humour, I love to work in a team, developing solid professional relationsihps built on trust, openness and respect.

## Projects

| Name (click to view repo) | Description | Tech/tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[RatRace](https://github.com/Ollie-HB/rat-race)** | For the final Makers group project, I helped to build a non-realtime game and clone of the childhood favourite Snakes and Ladders. My focus was on board logic, two-player functionality and graphic design. I also undertook much of the refactoring. | React, Jest, CSS |
| **[GrumbleBook](https://github.com/PatriciaGN/acebook-team-owlpaca)** | A group project building a clone of Facebook: here, we created a platform for users to sign up, log in and post their various grievances. I was able to focus on CSS, developing a retro 8-bit look with fonts, images and animations. | Javascript, Jest, MongoDB, Express, React, CSS, Node, Cypress, CSS |
| **[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/Cragg87/bank-tech-test)** | A solo project building a banking programme that lets a user deposit and/or withdraw from an account, and view a statement with balance. Operable from the command line. | JavaScript, Jest |
| **[Makers Reviews](https://github.com/Cragg87/Makers-Reviews)** | A series of live, anonymized assessments in which I was given non-technical user requirements and asked to convert these requirements into a working, tested, well-written application. Comprehensive feedback is included for each review. | Ruby, RSpec |
| **[MakersBnB](https://github.com/Arshad-Siddiqui/makersbnb-ruby-seed)** | A week-long group project building a basic clone of AirBnB, where users can sign up, log in, book a space or list their own spaces. I contributed to the sign-up and log-in features, investigating BCrypt for security. I also helped develop the database. | Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec, CSS |

## Skills

#### • Planning and organization
As a teacher, I have learnt to manage an extremely heavy and varied workload, ensuring that lessons are well researched, prepared and delivered, whilst keeping on top of marking, reports, correspondence and meetings. As a developer, my diagrams, design recipes and commit headings are integral to the successful production of code.

#### • Presentation and attention to detail
I take great pride in the professional standard of formatting for everything I produce, including educational resources, musical scores, videos and slides. I have a keen eye for detail, and have helped colleagues to spot coding errors quickly, producing clean, well formatted and readable code.

#### • Communication
Whether compering at concerts, preaching from the church pulpit, or teaching a class of young people, I communicate confidently whilst relating in a friendly and encouraging manner. I am careful to ensure information is accessibly presented, scaffolding for mixed abilities where necessary. In conversation or group discussion, I like to make others feel relaxed and able to contribute, using gentle humour to defuse any awkwardness or disquiet.

#### • Resourcefulness
During the pandemic, I was quick to adapt to online teaching and music making. I learnt to use new audio and video editing software, and led the way in producing videos for church services, virtual performances, and even my own comedy series on Youtube (youtube.com/c/CoronaComedy).

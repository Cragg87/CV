## Miles Cragg

Professional but personable, formal but funny, articulate, artistic (and alliterative, apparently), I have eagerly uprooted from a successful career in teaching to train and work as a software developer. I am delighted to have secured a place on the highly selective and renowned Makers Academy bootcamp in London, through which I am nurturing and growing my amateur coding skills towards a professional level suitable for launching a new career in software development. As a highly skilled musician and educator, I am driven by my desire for order, organization and precision, and have found these skills to be of temendous benefit in coding, where careful thought, evaluation and attention to detail are the key to clean and user-friendly source code.

## Skills

#### • Planning and organization
As a teacher, I have learnt to manage an extremely heavy and varied workload, ensuring that lessons are well researched, prepared and delivered, whilst keeping on top of marking, reports, correspondence and meetings. I have proved reliable and thorough in my duties.

#### • Presentation and attention to detail
I take great pride in the professional standard of formatting for everything I produce, including educational resources, musical scores, videos and slides. Well-known by colleagues for my grammatical precision and eye for detail, I am often called upon to proofread documents, which I enjoy doing.

#### • Communication
Whether compering at concerts, preaching from the church pulpit, or teaching a class of young people, I communicate confidently whilst relating in a friendly and encouraging manner. I am careful to ensure information is accessibly presented, scaffolding for mixed abilities where necessary. In conversation or group discussion, I like to make others feel relaxed and able to contribute, using gentle humour to defuse any awkwardness or disquiet.

#### • Resourcefulness
During the pandemic, I was quick to adapt to online teaching and music making. I learnt to use new audio and video editing software, and led the way in producing videos for church services, virtual performances, and even my own comedy series on Youtube (youtube.com/c/CoronaComedy).
